Q.3  How does “strictfp” ensure portability in Java?

Q.8   What is narrow/explicit/down type casting and what is  widening/implicit/up type casting?
Ans.  Narrow/Explicit/Down Type Casting -  Converting  a  higher data type into a lower one is    
            called narrowing type casting.
            Widening/Implicit/Up Type  -   Converting a lower data type into higher one is  called     
                widening type casting.
